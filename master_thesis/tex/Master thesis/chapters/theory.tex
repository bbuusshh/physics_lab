\section{Modeling light-molecule interaction.}
In order to gather control over the molecular emission the interaction of a molecule with a light pulse has to be modeled. The conventional approach is to solve optical Bloch equation describing the two-level system population dynamics. However, a molecule in a solid matrix cannot be treated as a closed system, hence requires a model involving coupling to the environment. ===Bloch-Redfield?=== The dynamics of a molecule in environment can be described as an open system in terms of density matrices via Lindblad master equation\cite{Manzano}.
