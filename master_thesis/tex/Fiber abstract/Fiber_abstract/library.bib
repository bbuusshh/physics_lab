abstract = {Photonic entanglement is one of the key resources in modern quantum optics. It opens the door to schemes such as quantum communication, quantum teleportation, and quantum-enhanced precision sensing. Sources based on parametric down-conversion or cascaded decays in atomic and atom-like emitters are limited because of their weak interaction with stationary qubits. This is due to their commonly broadband emission. Furthermore, these sources are commonly in the near-infrared such that quantum emitters in the blue spectral region, such as ions or many defect centers, cannot be addressed. Here, we present a sodium-resonant (589.0 nm) and narrow-band (14 MHz) degenerate entanglement source based on a single molecule. A beam-splitter renders two independently emitted photons into a polarization-entangled state. The quality of the entangled photon pairs is verified by the violation of Bell's inequality. We measure a Bell parameter of S$=$2.26{\textpm}0.05. This attests that the detected photon pairs exceed the classical limit; it is reconfirmed by quantum-state tomography and an analysis of the raw detector counts, which result in a value of S$=$2.24{\textpm}0.12. The tomography shows fidelity of 82\% to a maximally entangled Bell state. This work opens the route to background-free solid-state entanglement sources which surpass the probabilistic nature of the commonly used sources and are free from unwanted multi-photon events. The source is ideal for combination with stationary qubits such as atoms, ions, quantum dots, or defect centers.},

@article{qdFiber,
	Abstract = {In this work, we present a stand-alone and fiber-coupled quantum-light source. The plug-and-play device is based on an optically driven quantum dot delivering single photons via an optical fiber. The quantum dot is deterministically integrated in a monolithic microlens which is precisely coupled to the core of an optical fiber via active optical alignment and epoxide adhesive bonding. The rigidly coupled fiber-emitter assembly is integrated in a compact Stirling cryocooler with a base temperature of 35 K. We benchmark our practical quantum device via photon auto-correlation measurements revealing g(2)(0) = 0.07 $\pm$0.05 under continuous-wave excitation and we demonstrate triggered non-classical light at a repetition rate of 80 MHz. The long-term stability of our quantum light source is evaluated by endurance tests showing that the fiber-coupled quantum dot emission is stable within 4{\%} over several successive cool-down/warm-up cycles. Additionally, we demonstrate non-classical photon emission for a user-intervention-free 100-hour test run and stable single-photon count rates up to 11.7 kHz with a standard deviation of 4{\%}.},
